## About

:sparkles: A curated list of awesome articles, websites and resources about mental health in the software industry. :sparkles:

**Mental health** is a level of **psychological well-being** or **an absence of mental illness**. It's the psychological state of someone who is functioning at a satisfactory level of emotional and behavioural adjustment.

It includes subjective well-being, perceived self-efficacy, autonomy, competence, inter-generational dependence, and self-actualization of one's intellectual and emotional potential, among others.

> This list compiles several self-help resources we've personally found useful for a range of mental health problems, but in no way are they a replacement of professional help, psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy. **We're not experts**, and even if we were, most of these tools are meant as an aid to therapy, not as a substitute.
>
>**If you're in a crisis, please see [here](https://twloha.com/find-help/international-resources/), or [here](https://www.iasp.info/resources/Crisis_Centres/) for resources in your country.**
